### CSCI304 Lab 1
Carlo Mehegan
October 3, 2023

Total elapsed work time: 11h59m
- Lab work: 9h10m
- Studying C: 2h49m

Concerns, discoveries, comments:
- In an email Prof. Ren said we could get bonus credit in part 3 for dealing with certain corner cases. My program should be able to handle these cases.
- Prof. Ren also said that we can get bonus credit in part 4 if we properly deallocate memory. Based on my use of the valgrind tool, it looks like all of the allocated memory is properly deallocated at the end of the program.
- Is there extra credit for using version control? I was able to get git working between my computer and the lab machines and it was very helpful

Direction on how to run solutions:
- Part 3 requires a "lab1p3in" and "lab1p3out" inside of the same directory as the program
